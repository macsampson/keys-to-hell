## Notes for Implementation

- Each test should be isolated and not depend on others
- Mock external dependencies where appropriate
- Use test doubles for complex systems like EntityManager
- Parameterize tests for different upgrade types and rarity levels
- Focus on calculation accuracy and state management logic
- Test data flow between systems without UI dependencies
