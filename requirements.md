# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A web-based bullet-hell typing game inspired by Vampire Survivors, where players type sentences that scroll across the screen to launch attacks against waves of enemies. The game combines fast-paced typing mechanics with survival gameplay, featuring progression systems and increasing difficulty over time.

5. IF the player completes a sentence THEN the system SHALL spawn a new sentence after a brief delay

4. WHEN the player reaches higher levels THEN the system SHALL increase enemy spawn rates and difficulty
5. IF the player completes words at higher levels THEN the system SHALL launch multiple attacks or stronger attacks based on upgrades

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want responsive controls and smooth gameplay, so that my typing performance directly translates to game success.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN attacks are launched THEN the system SHALL display smooth projectile animations toward targets
3. WHEN multiple game elements are active THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent frame rate

5. IF the game becomes resource-intensive THEN the system SHALL optimize performance to maintain playability

### Requirement 5
